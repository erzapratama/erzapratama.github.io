                <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
                <p> My journey into the world of web development began at 19 in Purbalingga.
                    Driven by curiosity and a passion for technology, I've been diligently exploring the vast landscape of coding,
                    from crafting responsive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understanding the logic behind robust back-end systems.
                    Each project is a new adventure, a chance to learn and grow, pushing the boundaries of what I can create.
                    I'm excited to continue this path of endless learning and innovation </p>
